I used computer vision through OpenCV Libraries in order to track ping pong ball. Next, I attempt to calculate a homography using the edges of the table. Lastly, I apply the Delaunay effect for visuals and implement scorekeeping. All you need is a webcam and compter and you have got yourself an automated ping-pong referee.
